This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# Initialize the number of passengers on the bus
n_passengers <- 0

# Iterate over the stops
for (i in 1:10) {
  # Check if a passenger gets off the bus
  if (runif(1) < 0.2) {
    n_passengers <- n_passengers - 1
  }

  # Add a random number of passengers to the bus
  new_passengers <- sample(0:2, 1, prob=c(0.5, 0.4, 0.1))
  n_passengers <- n_passengers + new_passengers
}

# Check if the bus is empty
if (n_passengers == 0) {
  # The bus is empty
  probability <- 1
} else {
  # The bus is not empty
  probability <- 0
}

# Print the probability
print(probability)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
